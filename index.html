	<h3>Overview</h3>
	I am a Masters student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Ohio State University. 
	My graduate advisor is <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~raghu">Dr. Raghu Machiraju</a>. 
	
	Broadly I am interested in the application of neural networks in Computer Vision, auditory analysis, and NLP.
	
	Currently, I am working on a thesis project to use deep learning for classification of histology images.

	<h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3><br>
	<h3>Amazon, Seattle</h3>
	SDE Intern: June 2016 - August 2016 <br>
	Delivered the business partners with a visual tool which will be used to analyze the activity of customer service agents per contact (what they search for and what they click on), Java. 
	Used AWS products DynamoDB, Lambda and Kinesis to pipe the data from logs to a visualization tool on top of Elastic Search and Kibana<br><br>
	<h3>Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Bangalore</h3>
	Project Intern:	January 2015 â€“ June 2015 <br>
	Developed a consolidated utility to track multiple objects in multiple networked cameras in real-time. Features included: handshaking between multiple camera views for consistent object labeling, auto-initialization of the TLD (tracking-learning-detection) tracker using GMM based motion detector.<br><br>
	
	<h3>PROJECTS</h3><br>
	<h3>Convolutional Neural Networks for Irregular Data Points (Superpixels): Breast Cancer Stage Classification</h3>
		<i>Master's Project</i>, Advisor: <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~raghu">Prof. Raghu Machiraju</a>, Ohio State University <br>
		<b>Abstract:</b> Breast cancer image classification task has so far been limited to grade and histopathology
based categorization. In this project, we predict stage given only the digital whole slide images.
Convolutional neural networks are state-of-art models in image classification. However, in
previous work, convolutional networks have been used directly on raw pixel values. The entire
task of feature extraction is dependent on the model. In this project, we propose to use
convolutional neural networks at an intermediate stage on precomputed localized whole slide
image features. We treat features corresponding to irregular-shaped homogeneous compartments
of the image as data points. The challenge is to exploit the spatial arrangement of these irregular
points to create a a viable input for the convolutional neural network. We train and evaluate the
methodology on 2800 tiles obtained from the TCGA website.<br><br>
	<h3>Human Pose-Estimation Controlled Mario </h3>
	Traditional mario game uses keyboard input to make the mario jump, crouch, shoot etc. We (team of 3) developed a MATLAB based application that takes in webcam input of a person in real time, estimates the pose of the human as standing / crouching / jumping / shooting using computer vision techniques, and moves the mario accordingly.  <br>

	<h3>Recipe Visualizer</h3>
	It is the dream of many to have bots cook dinner after a long day of work. Cbots work with graphs. This project parses and visualizes a cooking recipe in a graph form. First each instruction is divided into action verb, ingredient and agent/location. A graph is created by connecting the ingredients and agents in each instruction set to the action verb. It is assumed that the result of an instruction is being carried forward onto the next instruction.<br>

	<h3>Music Signal Separation</h3>
	Humans have the ability to distinguish different tones in a complex sound structure such as human voices or different musical instruments. This model uses recurrent neural networks and soft-masking for music signal separation of monaural, synchronous violin and flute melodies mixed at 0dB. The model outputs signals such that each output signal is predominant in one instrument. This makes it easier for an average (not musically trained) person to figure out and track the melody played by constituting instruments. <br><br>
	<h3>Part-Of-Speech Tagger</h3>
	Used structured perceptron and Viterbi algorithm for part-of-speech tagging. Also did cross domain testing with Twitter, penn-tree bank and IRC chat data.<br><br>
